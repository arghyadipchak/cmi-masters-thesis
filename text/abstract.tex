We study the problem of capacity modification in many-to-one stable matching problems, where one side consists of workers and the other side consists of firms with capacity constraints. First, we study how the set of stable matchings changes when some seats are assigned to the firms. We examine whether firms and workers can improve or worsen upon changing the capacities under worker-proposing and firm-proposing deferred acceptable algorithms.

Second, we study how to optimally increase the capacities of the firms so as to obtain a stable and perfect matching. We consider two common optimality criteria, one aiming to minimize the sum of capacity increase of all schools (abbrv. as \textsc{MinSum}) and the other aiming to minimize the maximum capacity increase of any school (abbrv. as \textsc{MinMax}). We obtain a complete picture in terms of computational complexity and further investigate the parameterized complexity and approximability.

Finally, we finish by answering some questions that emerged while reviewing the first two parts. We consider scenarios with bound on capacity increase scale, varying costs for firms to increase capacity, and targeting only selected (of initially unmatched) workers to match.
